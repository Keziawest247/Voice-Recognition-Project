# Voice-Recognition-Project

The prerecorded audio file harvard.wav will be recognized and will return the speech. The project is ongoing.

# Steps Completed:
Define function recognize_speech_for_mic()
Initialize recognizer
Open micorphone as source
Load the prerecorded audio file
Recognize the audio using the Google's recognition service
Run the function

# Steps in progress:
- Make sure the prerecorded audio is in the right format on Pycharm to correctly loaf the audio file since it's a .wav file.
